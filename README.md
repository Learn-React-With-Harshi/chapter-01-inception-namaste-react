## Class Summary `Chapter-01 Inception` (24/12/2022)

Chapter-01 (Inception) was the first session of the Namaste React Live course. The whole class was excited about the beginning of a great course. We started learning react from scratch. Environment setup was clearly explained. Started with creating a simple Hello world program . First, using only  html, then we tried to implement the same through javascript. Finally, we created a simple hello world program using React. Everything was done without installing any package. Unlike other courses which starts with create-react-app as first session, we tried writing the react code from zero. It was a true inception session for  tranforming from ZERO to HERO in React.

One line about this chapter : `React is very simple, NO PANIC please.`
