Chapter-01 (Inception) was the first session of the Namaste React Live course. The whole class was excited about the beginning of a great course. We started learning react from scratch. Environment setup was clearly explained. Started with creating a simple Hello world program . First, using only  html, then we tried to implement the same through javascript. Finally, we created the simple hello worls program using React. It was a true inception session for  tranforming from ZERO to HERO in React.
